# Exoplanetary Habitability
  
</div>

As part of my freshman project at Politecnico di Milano, I analyzed all the parameters contributing to the habitability of exoplanets.

The paper is divided into 3 parts.

- 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗹𝗼𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀: Studied the distributions of data collected by the NASA Kepler Space Telescope and tried to explain the physical processes/phenomena that cause them.

- 𝗛𝘆𝗽𝗼𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗶𝘀 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: Read the most important scientific papers regarding exoplanets and validated them through statistical tests.

- 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻: Determined a model for the prediction of the planet's surface temperature using parameters of the planetary system of interest.
